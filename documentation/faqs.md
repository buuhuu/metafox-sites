| Header and Footer are NOT Blocks. How to create & decorate a non block components such as header / footer / text etc. also How exactly are JS/CSS applied on the Header & Footer components?                             | Refer <br/> https://www.aem.live/developer/block-collection/header & <br/> https://www.aem.live/developer/block-collection/footer <br/> The header and footer are loaded as part of the header and footer block in scripts.js https://github.com/adobe-rnd/aem-boilerplate-xwalk/blob/main/scripts/scripts.js#L92-L93                                                                                             |
| Changes to the CSS / JS of blocks & also creation of a new block followed by code check-in ensures availability on the universal editor. There is no package installation on AEM. How exactly is code available on AEM ? | Correct, there is NO deployment to AEM. The scripts from Edge Delivery Services project are loaded directly onto the page in AEM. Adobe uses a reverse proxy for that on /content/site.resource/<path-to-resource-on-project>, e.g. /content/site.resource/scripts/aem.js. We do so to workaround some CORS issues related to loading as modules. This is an implementation detail that may change in the future. |
| We assume that the Head.html as the first html that's being invoked. How/ where is this configured ?                                                                                                                     | The head.html is inlined into every page(not configurable). When serving the content for authoring in AEM, it loads the head.html to get the scripts and styles to add to the page, but will ignore anything else in it.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Can we create components by extending the OOB Blocks on AEM ?                                                                                                                                                            | NO. For each block the developer has to use the core/franklin/components/block/v1/block resource type - the generic implementation of the block logic in AEM. We do not recommend to use custom AEM resource types!                                                                                                                                                                                               |
